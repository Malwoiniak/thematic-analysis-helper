## General info

Thematic Analysis is a method of identifying and analyzing patterns of meanings in a dataset. As one of the most common methods within the field of qualitative analysis, it’s widely used on variety of data, such as field research, interviews, observation, solicited diaries and story completion [1]. The method consists of few phases, one of which is coding (tagging items of interest in data with a label: a few words or a short phrase). Such content analysis helps to primarily identify themes in next phase.

### An auxillary tool for thematic analysis

The preliminary purpose of the tool would be to serve child psychologists and counselors in initial assessment of child welfare. Behavior Diaries (solicited diaries) and story completion are among main qualitative research methods and are commonly used in developmental psychology [2-3]. Children are often asked to journal about their everyday life or given topic. The tool could be deployed as next step in analysis of such text.

With the help of this algorithm, users can facilitate following processes in their thematic analysis research: accessing online data of big volume, extracting the essence (information of interest), analyzing the content, plotting the most interesting data pieces in multiple way, training NLP machine learning model on data they choose, performing topic modeling on chosen data (or extraction of data).

### Case study

Three children’s blogs (due to similarity of blogs to journals and diaries) of high originality and distinct leading topics were taken up to test the tool on: [jakes-bones](http://www.jakes-bones.com), [lidbemchild](http://libdemchild.blogspot.com), [neversconds](http://neverseconds.blogspot.com). The goal was to present the diversity in children’s writing and provide an insight into tendencies, attitudes and dominating moods of what the same-age children journal about. The outcome of this algorithm’s run serves as an orientation platform for a researcher in the field of thematic analysis.

### What can it do?

Within this case study, the tool will: 
+access the content of eight consecutive years (or months) of blogging activity for each blog (libdemchild.com: years 2010-2017, jakes-bones.com: years 2009-2016, neverseconds.com: June 2012-December 2012 and year 2013) 
+ scrape the data from each post in chosen period
+ analyze the content of each post in all years and extract the most interesting data
+ use the same data to train simple machine learning model and visualize recurring topics that can be seen in each child writing.
